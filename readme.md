# KPI Dashboard

This is an implementation of **KPI dashboard made for Russian Railways High-speed Rail Department**. Created with [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3)/[C3.js](https://github.com/c3js/c3) in **one day** (the task was to make this dashboard ASAP).

So it's not meant to be a finished product, but just an example of how it might be. The data is just made up.
